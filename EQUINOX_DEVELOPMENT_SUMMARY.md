# EQUINOX Game Development Summary

This document provides a concise overview of the step-by-step process to develop the EQUINOX space shooter game using standard Java libraries (Swing/AWT).

## Development Process Overview

### 1. Project Setup
*   Create project directory structure and packages.
*   Configure a standard Java SE project (IDE or build tool).
*   Set up main window (`JFrame`).
*   Create basic README.

### 2. Core Framework
*   Implement main game class (`EquinoxGame`).
*   Create panel management system (switching `JPanel`s).
*   Set up rendering pipeline in `GamePanel` using `Graphics2D`.
*   Implement the main game loop.
*   Configure basic image loading (`ImageIO`).

### 3. Player Implementation
*   Create `PlayerShip` entity with position, velocity.
*   Implement rendering (drawing shapes or images).
*   Implement keyboard controls (KeyListeners/Bindings).
*   Add ship statistics (hull, shield, etc.).
*   Create basic damage handling.

### 4. Combat System
*   Add `Projectile` system.
*   Implement shooting mechanics.
*   Create custom collision detection (e.g., rectangle intersection).
*   Add visual and audio feedback (basic sounds with `javax.sound.sampled`).

### 5. Enemy Framework
*   Create base `Enemy` class.
*   Implement different enemy types (`ScoutShip`, etc.).
*   Design simple AI movement patterns.
*   Add enemy spawning system (waves).

### 6. Level Structure
*   Implement level progression (`LevelManager`).
*   Create level backgrounds (drawing with `Graphics2D`).
*   Implement wave-based spawning logic.
*   Define level completion criteria.

### 7. Upgrade System
*   Create `UpgradePanel` (`JPanel`).
*   Implement the four upgrade categories and stat modifications.
*   Handle persistent upgrades (saving/loading).

### 8. Boss Battles
*   Design unique boss patterns and AI.
*   Implement multi-phase battles if desired.
*   Create boss-specific attacks.
*   Add visual cues for boss state.

### 9. User Interface
*   Create `HUD` elements drawn on `GamePanel`.
*   Implement menus (`MainMenuPanel`, `OptionsPanel` using Swing or custom drawing).
*   Add `NarrativePanel` for story display.
*   Design `UpgradePanel` UI.

### 10. Polish
*   Add sound effects and music (`javax.sound.sampled`).
*   Implement simple particle effects (drawing shapes/images).
*   Optimize rendering performance.
*   Balance difficulty through testing.

## Key Java Classes (Pure Java)

1.  **EquinoxGame.java** - Main game class (`JFrame` management, loop).
2.  **GamePanel.java** - Main gameplay rendering area (`JPanel`).
3.  **PlayerShip.java** - Player entity.
4.  **Enemy.java** - Base enemy class.
5.  **Projectile.java** - Base projectile class.
6.  **CollisionSystem.java** - Custom collision detection logic.
7.  **LevelManager.java** - Handles level progression.
8.  **UpgradeSystem.java** - Manages upgrades.
9.  **InputHandler.java** - Processes user input.
10. **ImageLoader.java** / **SoundManager.java** - Resource loading utilities.
11. **HUD.java** - Draws in-game interface.

## Implementation Suggestions

### Start Small
*   Get a movable shape/sprite on screen first.
*   Add basic shooting.
*   Implement one enemy type.
*   Create a single test level within `GamePanel`.

### Incremental Development
*   Test each component as it's developed.
*   Add features one at a time.
*   Ensure core gameplay works before adding polish.
*   Use placeholder assets (simple shapes/colors) during development.

### Focus Areas
*   Ensure smooth, responsive controls (careful with input handling).
*   Achieve a stable frame rate (efficient game loop and rendering).
*   Balance difficulty progression.
*   Create varied enemy behaviors through AI logic.
*   Make upgrade choices meaningful.
*   Design distinctive boss fights.

## Technical Considerations (Pure Java)

### Rendering
*   Use `JPanel` and override `paintComponent(Graphics g)`.
*   Cast `Graphics` to `Graphics2D` for more features (transforms, anti-aliasing).
*   Use `Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().sync()` for smoother animation on some systems.
*   Consider double buffering manually or rely on Swing's default double buffering.
*   Load images using `ImageIO.read()` into `BufferedImage`.

### Game Loop
*   Implement a fixed time step or variable time step loop.
*   Carefully manage thread timing (`Thread.sleep` or more advanced timers).

### Input
*   Use KeyListeners attached to the `GamePanel` or `JFrame`.
*   Consider using Key Bindings for more robust input mapping.
*   Handle mouse input with MouseListeners if needed.

### Collision Detection
*   Implement custom logic (e.g., Axis-Aligned Bounding Box - AABB checks using `java.awt.Rectangle.intersects()`).
*   Optimize checks (e.g., spatial partitioning for large numbers of entities, though likely overkill initially).

### Sound
*   Use `javax.sound.sampled` package (`Clip`, `AudioSystem`, `AudioInputStream`).
*   Be mindful of supported audio formats (WAV is generally safe).

### Performance
*   Pool frequently created objects (projectiles, particles).
*   Optimize rendering: draw only visible elements, minimize complex drawing operations.
*   Optimize collision checks.

## Testing Approach

1.  Test core mechanics first (movement, shooting, basic collision).
2.  Focus on playability and responsiveness.
3.  Balance difficulty through extensive playtesting.
4.  Check performance and memory usage.
5.  Gather feedback on controls and game feel.

Following this process will allow for methodical, incremental development of the EQUINOX game using standard Java libraries while maintaining focus on creating engaging gameplay.
