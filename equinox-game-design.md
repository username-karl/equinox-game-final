# EQUINOX: Space Shooter
## Game Design Document

### Game Concept
In EQUINOX, players take on the role of Captain Nova, piloting a spacecraft through the dangerous reaches of space in search of a powerful ancient artifact that has been broken into four pieces. This fast-paced, top-down space shooter combines arcade-style combat with narrative elements and a progressive upgrade system, creating an engaging player experience that balances action with story.

### Core Gameplay Elements

#### Player Ship
The player's ship has four core stats that determine its performance:
- **Hull Integrity**: Your ship's health points
- **Shield Strength**: Absorbs damage before the hull takes hits
- **Weapon Power**: Determines your attack damage
- **Engine Power**: Affects your movement speed and maneuverability

#### Controls & Combat
- Classic arcade-style top-down shooter gameplay
- Mouse click or spacebar for shooting (fixed forward direction)
- Special abilities with cooldowns
- Dodge enemy projectiles while shooting down adversaries

#### Special Abilities
- Activated via dedicated keys (e.g., Q, E, R).
- Abilities have unique effects and cooldown periods.
- Examples:
    - **Q: Wave Blast:** ranged energy wave.
    - **E: Laser Beam:** Fires a continuous, piercing beam for a short duration.
    - **R: Phase Shift:** Become temporarily invulnerable to all damage.
- (Requires UI elements to show cooldown status).

### Game Structure
The game consists of 4 locations, each containing 5 levels culminating in a boss fight. After completing each level, players visit a Shop and then choose one Upgrade to enhance their ship.

## Opening Sequence
