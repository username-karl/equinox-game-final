# Product Context

## Problem / Motivation
Players enjoy the challenge and satisfying feedback loop of classic arcade space shooters. However, many lack significant long-term progression beyond score chasing. Equinox aims to combine the immediate action of the genre with a compelling upgrade system that encourages replayability and allows players to tailor the ship to their preferred playstyle.

## How it Works
- The player controls a ship navigating vertically scrolling space.
- Enemies appear in waves, firing projectiles at the player.
- The player dodges incoming fire and destroys enemies using a primary weapon and limited-use tactical abilities.
- Defeated enemies grant score and potentially drop currency.
- Between stages (or via a dedicated menu - TBD Shop implementation), players can spend currency to upgrade various ship attributes.
- Gameplay difficulty increases through subsequent waves and stages, culminating in boss battles.
- The game cycle repeats until the player is defeated or completes the final stage.

## Desired User Experience
- **Feel:** Challenging, Empowering, Rewarding, Responsive.
- **Flow:** Fast-paced action during waves, punctuated by tense boss encounters and strategic decisions during upgrade phases.
- **Feedback:** Clear visual and audio cues for hits, kills, damage taken, ability readiness, and successful upgrades.
- **Interface:** Intuitive controls (likely keyboard-based), easy-to-read HUD, and straightforward menu navigation.
- **Aesthetics:** (Inferred) Retro pixel art style consistent with the genre inspiration.
