# Progress

## What Works and Current Status
- **Gameplay:** Core loop is functional: player movement, shooting, enemy spawning/movement, basic collision, upgrades, world/wave progression.
- **HUD:**
  - Relocated to the bottom of the screen for better visibility.
  - Visual bars for ability cooldowns.
  - Health bar color changes at low health (Yellow < 50%, Red < 25%).
  - Health text includes HP upgrade level.
  - Displays current levels for Damage, Speed, and Rate upgrades.
  - Fixed overlap issue between HP bar and cooldown bars.
- **Entities:** Player, BasicEnemy, Bullet entities exist.
- **Upgrades:** Damage, Speed, Fire Rate, Health upgrades functional.
- **Enemy AI:** Enemies move horizontally and now move down when hitting *either* screen border.

## What Works
- Basic game structure (JPanel, game loop).
- Player ship movement (left/right with acceleration/deceleration based on upgrades).
- Placeholder enemy movement and spawning (basic patterns, stage progression). 
- Player abilities (Wave Blast, Laser Beam, Phase Shift) with cooldowns managed in `GameUpdateSystem` and tied to upgrades in `GameState`.
- **New:** Player basic shooting (SPACE key) now uses a cooldown system managed in `GameUpdateSystem`.
- **New:** Holding SPACE allows continuous firing (respecting cooldown).
- **New:** Fire rate upgrade (`fireRateUpgradeLevel`) now correctly reduces the bullet cooldown.
- Basic collision detection (player bullets vs enemies, enemy bullets vs player, tactical abilities vs enemies).
- **New:** Player bullet damage now scales with `damageUpgradeLevel`.
- **New:** Player fires 2 **parallel** shots simultaneously when Damage upgrade reaches level 4+.
- Game state management (`GameStateEnum` in `EquinoxGameLogic`).
- Basic HUD rendering (score, money, health) via `RenderingSystem`.
- **New:** HUD now displays visual bars for ability cooldowns.
- **New:** HUD Health bar changes color at low health and displays HP upgrade level.
- **New:** HUD displays current levels for DMG, SPD, RATE upgrades.
- **New:** HUD layout redesigned, moved elements from top to bottom.
- Basic Asset Loading (`AssetLoader`).
- Main Menu navigation and basic functionality (Start, Leaderboard, Cheats, Exit).
- Game Over detection and handling (including win condition and prompting for leaderboard name).
- Leaderboard viewing (`LeaderboardPanel`).
- Cheat system (toggle, money bonus).
- Implement Shop system functionality.

## What's Left to Build
- Populate remaining Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `techContext.md`).
- Implement specific enemy types/behaviors for Worlds 2, 3, and 4.
- Implement specific Miniboss/Main Boss behaviors for Worlds 2, 3, and 4.
- Implement Settings menu functionality.
- Implement Credits display.
- Refine enemy spawning patterns and difficulty scaling.
- Add visual/audio feedback for game events (shooting ready, damage taken, ability use, etc.).
- Implement detailed cutscenes between stages.
- General polishing, bug fixing, and balancing.

## Current Status
- Core gameplay loop is functional with basic shooting, abilities, and enemies for World 1.
- Player shooting mechanic has been revamped to include cooldown and continuous fire.
- Player bullet damage upgrade implemented, granting a parallel multi-shot effect at higher levels.
- **Next Task:** Implementing the full shop system.
- Shop system implemented and functional.
- HUD cooldown indicators improved (visual bars).
- HUD polished (HP bar colors/level, key upgrade level display).
- HUD layout improved for better visibility.

## Known Issues
- Memory Bank files need initial population.
